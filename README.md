Lambda Twitter Blog Poster  
=================  
> Automagically post to Twitter timeline about new blog post using Go on AWS Lambda.  

**TL;DR** Events are generated using webhooks - Gitlab in this case because that's where I store my site. On specific commit events (the commits contain a [NEW POST] block), a Twitter status is pushed to my timeline.
